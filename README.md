## Managing-Big-Data-with-MySQL
This course was completed on Coursera in my free time as I aim to practise and understand SQL syntax more in-depthly. 
The files in this repository are practise questions that allowed me to generate queries from scratch to extract the relevant data or generate the required table of data to satisfy the business query. The database used is from a company called Dognition with different breeds of dogs that performed behavioural tests to categorize or label them with a personality trait. The data consists of dog IDs, location, gender, test completed, date-time and many more parameters that the company and pet owners use to track their dog's performance better.

### Excercise 1
Using Jupyter Labs, we use SQL library each time we generate a query. We connect to Dognition's Database with %sql mysql://studentuser:studentpw@mysqlserver/dognitiondb and start practising SHOW, DESCRIBE, SELECT, FROM and LIMIT clauses.

### Excercise 2
In this excercise we begin WHERE, IN, NULL, LIKE, YEAR, MONTH clauses to..........  Operators like -, +, <, = are introduced and practised.

### Excercise 3
Excercise 3 focuses on DISTINCT, ORDER BY, DESC, ASC, IS NOT, AND, REPLACE, TRIM,
