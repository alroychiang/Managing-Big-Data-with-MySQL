## Managing-Big-Data-with-MySQL
This course was completed on Coursera in my free time as I aim to practise and understand SQL syntax more in-depthly. 
The files in this repository are practise questions that allowed me to generate queries from scratch to extract the relevant data or generate the required table of data to satisfy the business query. The database used is from a company called Dognition with different breeds of dogs that performed behavioural tests to categorize or label them with a personality trait. The data consists of dog IDs, location, gender, test completed, date-time and many more parameters that the company and pet owners use to track their dog's performance better.
