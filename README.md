## Managing-Big-Data-with-MySQL
This course was completed on Coursera in my free time as I aim to practise and understand SQL syntax more in-depthly. 
The files in this repository are practise questions that I must geneerate queries from scratch to extract the relevant data or generate the required table of data to satisfy the questions requirement. The database used is from a company called Dognition with different breeds of dogs that performed behavioural tests to categorize or label them with a personality trait. The data consists of dog IDs, location, gender, test completed, date-time and many more parameters that the company and pet owners use to track their dog's performance better.
